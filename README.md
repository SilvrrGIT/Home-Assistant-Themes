# Home-Assistant Themes

## Default Theme Template
This is a theme that should closely match the default theme of HA, this should also provide a good starting point for developing a new theme.

## Midnight Theme
This is the main theme that I use for my HA instance.  It was started from another 'midnight' theme and tweaked over time to what it is now.
